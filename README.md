# tetris-localsearch
An AI project to design an agent to play a game of Tetris

Page Rank is written and maintained by Yu Pei Henry. It was tried and tested in early stages
of the project but did not yield a proficient tetris agent. The Page Rank code was ran on NSCC and some statistics was recorded:

Ran on 12 cores NSCC for 2 hours

Completed 12 iterations with 479130 vertices on a sparse graph

Main Project is jointly written by Tan Mingrui, Wang Deband, Yu Pei Henry and Zhang Hui. This is the final code used for the project.
See [report](report.pdf) for findings of the project.
